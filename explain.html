<h1>Create a registration form using HTML and CSS</h1>

<pre>
    The HTML part for this is quite simple. A large portion of the code was dedicated to the form, where different inputs were contained with-in labels.
    I had some fun writing some of the texts. For whatever reason, some colors won't appear when I use color names in part of the HTML, so I reverted to hex code for compability.
    I'm still a bit unfamilliar about the CSS part, so I spent quite a lot of time adjusting it to avoid everything looking stretched.
