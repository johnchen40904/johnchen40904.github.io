  <h1>The Beginning</h1>
  <p class="story-text">
I lay awake in my dorm room, staring at the ceiling as the sounds of shouting and laughter drifted in through the window. The noise was getting louder and louder, and I couldn't take it anymore. I needed to do something about it.  </p>
  <button class="choice-button" onclick="location.href='1.html'">I could ignore the noise and try to fall asleep, hoping it would eventually die down.</button>
  <button class="choice-button" onclick="location.href='2.html'">I could go outside and confront the people making the noise, telling them to keep it down.</button>
  <button class="choice-button" onclick="location.href='3.html'">I could sneak out of my room and investigate the source of the noise, to see if something more sinister was happening.</button>
