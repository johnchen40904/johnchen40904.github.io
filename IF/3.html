  <h1>The Beginning</h1>
  <p class="story-text">
 I decide to sneak out of my room and investigate the source of the noise. I carefully open my window and climb out, moving quietly through the darkness. As I get closer to the source of the noise, I realize that it's coming from the old abandoned building on campus.
  </p>
  <button class="choice-button" onclick="location.href='1.html'">Go back to my room and call campus security, telling them about the noise coming from the abandoned building.</button>
  <button class="choice-button" onclick="location.href='2.html'">Investigate the abandoned building, despite the danger.</button>
  <button class="choice-button" onclick="location.href='3.html'">Try to find a way to block out the noise, like finding earplugs or playing music in my room.</button>
