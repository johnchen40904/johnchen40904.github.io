  <h1>The Beginning</h1>
  <p class="story-text">
I decide to go outside and confront the people making the noise. I open my door and step out into the hallway, only to find that it's empty. The shouts and laughter are still coming from outside, but there's no one in sight.
  </p>
  <button class="choice-button" onclick="location.href='1.html'">Go back to my room and lock the door, hoping the noise will eventually die down.</button>
  <button class="choice-button" onclick="location.href='2.html'">Continue outside, following the noise to its source.</button>
  <button class="choice-button" onclick="location.href='3.html'">Call the campus security and report the disturbance.</button>
