  <h1>The Beginning</h1>
  <p class="story-text">
I decide to ignore the noise and try to fall asleep. I toss and turn in my bed, but the shouts and laughter only seem to get louder. After an hour of trying to sleep, I can't take it anymore. I need to do something.
  </p>
  <button class="choice-button" onclick="location.href='1.html'">I could go outside and confront the people making the noise, telling them to keep it down.</button>
  <button class="choice-button" onclick="location.href='2.html'"> I could sneak out of my room and investigate the source of the noise, to see if something more sinister was happening.</button>
